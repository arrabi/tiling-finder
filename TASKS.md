# Task List

## Completed
- [x] Set up project scaffolding with Node.js/Express and a basic frontend.
- [x] Implement an initial search module with file-based state persistence.
- [x] Expose API endpoints to start the search and retrieve saved patterns.
- [x] Build a minimal HTML/JS interface to start the search and display patterns.
- [x] Document development and usage instructions.
- [x] Enforce adjacency and similarity constraints in the search algorithm.

## Remaining
- [ ] Goal of the app is to find all patterns that can tile successfully (Tileable). Any pattern that is not tileable should be discarded (saved in the progress file, so that we do not search it again). Both patterns and tiles should not have empty spaces between the squares.
- [ ] Add user controls for configuring search parameters.
- [ ] Create automated tests for search logic and API endpoints.
- [ ] Package app for deployment and provide containerization instructions.
